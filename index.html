    <h1> My 3 Top Favorite Candies</h1>
    <hr>
    <ol>
      <h3><li> Skittles</li></h3>
      <p> When it comes to hard candy, skittles has to be one of my most favorite hard candy, I enjoy every flavor of them even if its grape. I love the taste of the rainbow.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3><li> Twix</li></h3>
      <p> Im not really a big fan of chocolate but twix is super good. I love its cookie waffer texture and the stretchy caramel that it has and its hard layer of chocolate covering up the cookie waffer and caramel. Wiether its left or right twix, twix is my number one favorite chocolate.</p>

      <h3><li> Air Head Xtremes</li></h3>
      <p> I'm not really into sour candy either, mainly because I simply cant handle much of it but air head xtremes are sour candy but their not too sour. They have the right amount on them and after the sourness I enjoy the sweetness of them.</p>
